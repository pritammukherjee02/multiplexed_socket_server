# Multiplexed Socket Server using Golang

Uses reused connections and concepts of epolling and multiplexing to reach a high connection maintainablity of 1 million+ simultaneous connections at under 1 GiB of Memory

This is a simple server originally inspired by the design of Eran Yanay's attempt at making it. Additional logic can be added to it. Or, we can make it into a library in the future.
